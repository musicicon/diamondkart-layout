Hello there folks. This is a template project in CSS and HTML.
I've created a website layout for a diamond ecommerce website.
This project is done inorder to gain experience in flexbox, grids, website aesthetics, design details, etc.
Hope you find the layout of my site soothing. 
p.s. And maybe one day I'll sell real diamonds on my site :)
Have fun!!!

p.s. The website is called diamond kart .com
